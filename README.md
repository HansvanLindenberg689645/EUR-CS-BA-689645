This is the python code for Computer Science & Business Analytics (FEM21037). This code tackles the challenge of identifying duplicate products across online shops, given the surge in online shopping and the need for aggregated product data. It addresses diverse product descriptions through effective representation, emphasizing Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for scalability. This code has everything in one file ”CSBA-Assignment”. My “programming buddy” for this assignment was Fanne Conijn (685880).
